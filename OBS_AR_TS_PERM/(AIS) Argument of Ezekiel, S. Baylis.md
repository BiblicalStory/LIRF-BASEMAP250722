## Message of the Book  

**Problem:** Judah can no longer support either a Davidic king or the LORD’s presence, having defiled the temple through pride, bloodshed, and harlotry with false gods (serpent-images).  

**Solution:** God will bring down the exalted nations/serpent and magnify His own glory by saving a remnant of Israel through a **New Davidic King**, a **Second Exodus**, **resurrection**, and **Sabbath sanctification** in a **new Temple** where the LORD dwells in the midst of His people.  

**Abbreviated Message Statement:**  
The LORD no longer dwells in Jerusalem but will magnify Himself (38:23) by sanctifying Israel from bloodshed through a new heart, resurrection (37), and a Second Exodus to a new Temple where the LORD dwells among the Levites.

## Unique Contributions  

1. **Bloodshed as Cain-Abel Paradigm**  
   - Bloodshed in Ezekiel is not mere ritual defilement but a replay of Cain slaying Abel: the seed of the serpent opposing the seed of the woman.  
   - Jerusalem’s murder of prophets anticipates the ultimate bloodshed of the Seed Himself.  

2. **King as Greater Moses**  
   - Ezekiel portrays the LORD as King leading a Second Exodus (20:33).  
   - The Davidic prince in chs. 40–48 parallels Moses’ unique intimacy, eating bread in God’s presence (44:3).  

3. **Ark of the Covenant Motif**  
   - The ark is conspicuously absent in Ezekiel’s temple.  
   - The presence of the LORD Himself, enthroned as the true Image/Seed, replaces the ark (Jer. 3).  

4. **Temple as Female / Harlotry as Infidelity**  
   - The temple represents the feminine dimension, while Israel prostituting herself to “male images” reflects betrayal of the true Man/Image.  

5. **Romance / Anti-Romance Framework**  
   - Ezekiel’s closing vision (chs. 40–48) pictures Eden restored: cherubim, palm trees, flowing river, David eating in God’s presence.  
   - This integrates Reg Grant’s pregeneric plot (anti-romance → romance).

## Structure of the Argument  

### I. Introduction (1–2)  
- The glory of the LORD appears in Babylon, not Jerusalem.  
- A Man is enthroned within the cherubim.  
- **Contribution:** Anticipates the restored temple (chs. 40–48), where the glory will return and dwell permanently.

### II. First Message to the House of Israel (3–39)  

#### A. Scroll of Lamentations (3–19)  
- Israel’s elders inquire of Ezekiel, but idols shut them out from God’s true Word.  
- The glory departs the temple; Jerusalem can no longer support a Davidic king.  
- **Contribution:** Israel walks in Cain’s path, murdering prophets and prostituting herself to false images.  

#### B. Message to the Elders (20–39) — *Sabbath Frame*  
- **Frame:** Opens with Sabbath theology (20) and closes with sanctuary-in-their-midst (37:28).  
- Sabbath = the sign of God’s sanctifying work through Exodus.  
- Themes: new heart (36), resurrection (37), and sanctification reversing defilement.  
- **Climax:** Gog and Magog (38–39) = the eschatological conclusion, where exalted nations are brought low and the LORD is sanctified through restored Israel.

### III. Second Message to the House of Israel (40–48)  
- Vision of the new temple: cherubim and palm trees indicate Eden restored.  
- The glory of the LORD returns (43).  
- David the prince has free access to God’s presence (44:3).  
- Zadokite priests minister at the LORD’s table, while other Levites remain restricted.  
- A river flows from the temple, bringing life to the Dead Sea (47).  
- **Contribution:** The absence of the ark, the presence of the Man, and the sanctified ordering of priesthood mark the climactic resolution: *“The LORD is there.”*

## Theological Arc  

- **Defilement:** Israel’s harlotry, pride, and bloodshed expel the LORD’s glory.  
- **Sanctification:** Through Sabbath, Second Exodus, new heart, and resurrection, God magnifies Himself.  
- **Restoration:** The new Temple, flowing river, and Davidic prince signal Eden’s renewal and the LORD’s permanent presence.

## Message Statement
The gospel of Mark proclaims that the eternal Word with authority—fulfilled in Jesus the Servant through His death, resurrection, and ascension—is now entrusted to the disciples, who by the Spirit (by the ascended Ps. 110 Melchizedekian priest) carry the imperishable proclamation for eternal salvation.

## Narrative Arc

### I. Setting (1–2)
- Jesus is introduced as the Isaianic Servant, the Word with authority, inaugurating the new Exodus.  
- His authority extends from teaching to healing, forgiving sins, and fulfilling Sabbath rest (cf. Ex. 31:13).  
- The people marvel, while leaders begin to question.  

**Contribution:** Establishes Jesus as the fulfillment of Isaiah 40, the eternal restful Word that never fades, and introduces the conflict with Jewish leadership.

---

### II. Conflict (3:1–30)
- Leaders reject Jesus, plotting His death and accusing Him of operating by Beelzebul.  
- In contrast, Jesus appoints a remnant of twelve to be with Him and to proclaim the Word.  
- These form the new family in "the house": those who do the will of God (faith in the Word with authority and spread it to others).  

**Contribution:** Frames Israel’s rejection as the setting for a Spirit-empowered remnant to emerge.

---

### III. Rising Action (3:31–15:15)
- Jesus demonstrates that God’s will is accomplished through His Word and Spirit alone, not through external identity, ritual purity, wealth, or temple structures.  
- The disciples, though weak, are drawn into a new family shaped by humble service.  
- Images of growth (mustard seed, crops, bread multiplication) portray the mysterious expansion of God’s kingdom.  
- Geography underscores mission: Galilee as the light for the nations, the Via Maris as pathway to Gentiles (cf. Is. 9, the "Way of the Sea, Galilee of the Gentiles"), journeys to Tyre and Gennesaret signaling outward movement.  
- The temple is exposed as corrupt and destined to fall, with a new community arising in its place.  

**Contribution:** Illustrates that the Servant accomplishes salvation alone, yet forms a community that will carry His Word into the world.



**EXCURSIS: Eschatology in Mark** **(S. Baylis direct authored)**

Mark's eschatological layout is very similar but compacted in relationship to Matthew's (Matt. 24). 

Jesus' discourse is laid out in Mark in the following way in response to the disciples' question "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?"

The direct answer to this question (the SIGN) is that there will be an increase of "war, famine and death" (cf. Lev. 26, Deut. 28, Rev. 7, 1st half of Daniel's 70th week) which leads right into the abomination of desolation (the time of the seventh seal in Revelation), which is when the reader should *really* get out of town because that is going to be the GREAT tribulation (2nd half of Daniel's 70th week, 13:5-31). 

The above (13:5–31) is the SIGN (in answer to their question) of the end (the tribulation/70th Week of Daniel), and this sign is the budding fig tree of Israel's return to God in Jesus, the Word from the OT — this return is the purpose of the 1st half of Daniel's 70th week.

Next, Jesus tells them (13:32–37) WHEN (in answer to their question), and he tells them that no one knows when this period will begin, so they should be on the alert, but once it starts happening (the fig tree budding), the present generation (at that time) will not pass away before it is all concluded.

### IV. Climax (15:16–16:8)
- Israel slays the Passover Lamb; Jesus bears rejection alone, fulfilling Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22.  
- The centurion declares Him Son of God at His death.  
- The temple veil is torn, signaling the end of the old order.  
- Resurrection reveals that the mission will continue from Galilee to the nations.  

**Contribution:** The decisive act of the Servant secures salvation and inaugurates the Spirit-empowered community.

---

### V. Falling Action (16:9–14)
- The disciples remain unbelieving, echoing their repeated failures.  
- Jesus rebukes them, preparing them to show compassion toward future unbelief.  

**Contribution:** Highlights the necessity of grace—the mission rests not on disciples’ strength but on Jesus’ authority.

---

### VI. Resolution (16:14–19)
- Jesus commissions the disciples to carry the gospel (the Word with authority) into the world.  
- Their proclamation is confirmed by signs, and salvation is marked by Spirit-baptism.  
- The ascended Christ, seated at God’s right hand, is now the source of ongoing authority (Ps. 110 fulfilled).  

**Contribution:** Balances the setting—just as Jesus embodied the Word with authority, now His disciples carry it forward under His Melchizedekian priesthood (Ps. 110).

---

### VII. Denouement (16:20)
- The disciples preach the imperishable proclamation (the Word with authority), producing eternal salvation.  
- The Lord works with them, confirming the Word by signs.  

**Contribution:** The gospel continues as the Word with authority, extending the new Exodus to all nations.

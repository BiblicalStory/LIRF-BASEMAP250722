Baylis, Samuel Andrew and GPT5. "(AIS) The Literary Argument of Luke." REV. X. BiblicalStory L-IRF, 2025.

**Message Statement:**  
Jesus, the only worthy Israelite, came to identify with unworthy Israel so as to bring forgiveness of sins in the New Covenant through the forgiven apostles to all nations who recognize their need for it.

## Narrative Framework

- **Setting (1–3):**  
  Jesus, Son of God/Adam/David, comes as salvation to the humble. John the Baptist as OT witness, Jesus as fulfillment.  

- **Conflict (4–11):**  
  Israel, in pride, rejects forgiveness and accuses Jesus of Satanic power. The Pharisees become Cain-like; Israel refuses to be light to the nations as old Jonah did.  

- **Rising Action (12–22:38):**  
  Jesus trains His little flock to endure the delay with humility, mercy, and forgiveness, unlike self-righteous Israel.  

- **Climax (22:39–24:8):**  
  Jesus is counted with sinners (which is what the Pharisees DID NOT want to do), dies as greater Abel, rises in vindication, opening Paradise.  

- **Falling Action (24:10–43):**  
  The risen Jesus fulfills the Scriptures physically; apostles inherit the role of eye-witnesses (witnesses that Jesus fulfilled OT) empowered by the greater Jonah (sign of Jonah).  

- **Resolution (24:44–49):**  
  Apostles clothed with Spirit’s power to proclaim forgiveness to all nations from Jerusalem.  

- **Denouement (24:50–53):**  
  Jesus ascends, completing the Exodus; apostles wait in temple for Spirit, leading seamlessly into Acts.

6. In the point where the main conflict is introduced, Jesus says to Simon, “For this reason, I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.” The core of this love was directed to Jesus, because she kissed Jesus’ feet and anointed Him with oil. Thus, because Jesus forgave her (7:48), she loved much. This is what is going to be opposed, because it would be Jesus whom they would kill.

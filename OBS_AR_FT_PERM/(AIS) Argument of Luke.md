**Message Statement:**  
Jesus, the only worthy Israelite, came to identify with unworthy Israel so as to bring forgiveness of sins in the New Covenant through the forgiven apostles to all nations who recognize their need for it.

## Narrative Framework

- **Setting (1–3):**  
  Jesus, Son of God/Adam/David, comes as salvation to the humble. John the Baptist as OT witness, Jesus as fulfillment.  

- **Conflict (4–11):**  
  Israel, in pride, rejects forgiveness and accuses Jesus of Satanic power. The Pharisees become Cain-like; Israel refuses to be light to the nations as old Jonah did.  

- **Rising Action (12–22:38):**  
  Jesus trains His little flock to endure the delay with humility, mercy, and forgiveness, unlike self-righteous Israel.  

- **Climax (22:39–24:8):**  
  Jesus is counted with sinners (which is what the Pharisees DID NOT want to do), dies as greater Abel, rises in vindication, opening Paradise.  

- **Falling Action (24:10–43):**  
  The risen Jesus fulfills the Scriptures physically; apostles inherit the role of witnesses empowered by the greater Jonah (sign of Jonah).  

- **Resolution (24:44–49):**  
  Apostles clothed with Spirit’s power to proclaim forgiveness to all nations from Jerusalem.  

- **Denouement (24:50–53):**  
  Jesus ascends, completing the Exodus; apostles wait in temple for Spirit, leading seamlessly into Acts.

**Message Statement:**  
Jesus, the only worthy Israelite, came to identify with unworthy Israel so as to bring forgiveness of sins in the New Covenant through the forgiven apostles to all nations who recognize their need for it.

## Narrative Framework

- **Setting (1–3):**  
  Jesus, Son of God/Adam/David, comes as salvation to the humble. John the Baptist as OT witness, Jesus as fulfillment.  

- **Conflict (4–11):**  
  Israel, in pride, rejects forgiveness and accuses Jesus of Satanic power. The Pharisees become Cain-like; Israel refuses to be light to the nations as old Jonah did.  

- **Rising Action (12–22:38):**  
  Jesus trains His little flock to endure the delay with humility, mercy, and forgiveness, unlike self-righteous Israel.  

- **Climax (22:39–24:8):**  
  Jesus is counted with sinners (which is what the Pharisees DID NOT want to do), dies as greater Abel, rises in vindication, opening Paradise.  

- **Falling Action (24:10–43):**  
  The risen Jesus fulfills the Scriptures physically; apostles inherit the role of eye-witnesses (witnesses that Jesus fulfilled OT) empowered by the greater Jonah (sign of Jonah).  

- **Resolution (24:44–49):**  
  Apostles clothed with Spirit’s power to proclaim forgiveness to all nations from Jerusalem.  

- **Denouement (24:50–53):**  
  Jesus ascends, completing the Exodus; apostles wait in temple for Spirit, leading seamlessly into Acts.  


## Excursus: Eschatology in Luke (Luke 17; 21)

Luke presents eschatology through two distinct but complementary lenses: the **immediacy of the Son of Man’s return** (Luke 17) and the **panoramic sweep of the inter-advent age** (Luke 21).

### 1. Luke 17: The Immediacy of Return
- Addressed to the “little flock” (12:32, the training of the "little flock" is the rising action as well as the immediate context of ch. 17, cf. 17:1–4), Jesus warns that the Son of Man’s day will come suddenly, like lightning.  
- The analogies of Noah and Lot emphasize that life will appear normal, until sudden preservation divides the remnant from the judged.  
- Those “taken” are best seen as those preserved, since in both Noah and Lot, the departing are the saved (see also, Bock and Simpson, *Jesus According to Scripture*, 389). Those left are consumed, symbolized by vultures gathering over corpses (cf. Ezekiel 38—39).  
- This passage thus underscores the **rapture-like immediacy** of Jesus’ return: the remnant must always be ready to be delivered suddenly from judgment.

### 2. Luke 21: The Age of Waiting and Witness
- Here the focus broadens: from Jesus’ ascension until His bodily return, the “little flock” will endure a span of difficulty, persecution, and delay.  
- The destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70) is portrayed as both judgment and foreshadowing of the larger period of delay.  
- This aligns with Peter’s testimony in Acts 3:21, that heaven must receive Christ “until the period of restoration.”  
- Thus Luke 21 situates the church’s witness in a **long horizon of endurance**, while still pressing toward the climactic return of the Son of Man.

---

Together, Luke 17 and 21 form a coherent eschatological voice:
- The “little flock” must live with **imminent expectation** (17) while also persevering through the **extended delay** (21).  
- The Son of Man will come suddenly, but also certainly, at the end of the age.

2. C. Baylis.  

3. The author would like to acknowledge F. Fenby for pointing out that the essence of Abel’s sacrifice was not its bloodiness, but rather its substitutionary dynamic.  

4. The author first heard of this concept from A. Gonzales.  

5. Charles P. Baylis, “Luke Commentary: Luke 1:1–3:23,” *BiblicalStory*, 2015, http://thebiblicalstory.org/baylis/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LukeLec1to4060915.pdf.  

6. In the point where the main conflict is introduced, Jesus says to Simon, “For this reason, I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.” The core of this love was directed to Jesus, because she kissed Jesus’ feet and anointed Him with oil. Thus, because Jesus forgave her (7:48), she loved much. This is what is going to be opposed, because it would be Jesus whom they would kill.

9. C. Baylis notes that this reference to greed is an allusion to Gehazi’s unwise actions. This further develops the Elijah/Elisha motif that C. Baylis points out in his work on this topic. See Charles P. Baylis, *The Elijah/Elisha Motif in Luke 7—10 As Related to the Purpose of the Book of Luke* (Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985), 40, *BiblicalStory*, http://thebiblicalstory.org/baylis/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Elijah_Elisha_Luke_Thesis_Baylis_1985.pdf.  

10. The allusion to Deut. 30 was pointed out to this author by C. Baylis.  

11. C. Baylis has pointed out that the Pharisees thought that their status of wealth and success “endeared” them to God. Nothing could be further from the truth.

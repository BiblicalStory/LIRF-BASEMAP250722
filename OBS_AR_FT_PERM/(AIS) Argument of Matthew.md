## Message of Matthew

The virgin-born King, the Righteous One, comes to save Israel from their sins. When the nation rejects Him and blasphemes the Spirit, a remnant is preserved who receive His righteousness. This remnant, purified in the struck Shepherd, becomes the seed of a new ecclesia that will bear fruit among all nations until the King returns to reign.

  

**Abbreviated Message:**

Through the Shepherd-King, the remnant of Israel is equipped to take the gospel of the kingdom to all nations.

## Plot Structure

  
  

### I. Setting (1–11)

Jesus is introduced as the promised Seed — the new Adam and Son of David — born of a virgin. He fulfills the Isaianic promise (Is. 7–12) that a child would bring light to Galilee.

- **Isaiah 9:** The “great light” dawns on Zebulun and Naphtali. Jesus begins His ministry in Galilee of the Gentiles, calling fishermen from this region to be His first disciples. These Galilean disciples become the nucleus of the remnant, trained to carry the message to all nations.

- **Discourse 1 (5–7):** Sermon on the Mount — true righteousness is found only in Jesus, the Righteous One. This righteousness is obtained by first hungering and thirsting for it and then asking and receiving in humility.

- **Development (8–9):** Jesus cleanses the unclean, forgives sins, and demonstrates mercy greater than Jonah by extending deliverance even to Gentiles.

  
  

### II. Tension/Conflict (10–12)

The disciples are sent to Israel as heralds, but opposition mounts. The Pharisees reject Jesus’ rest, accuse Him of blasphemy, and finally blaspheme the Spirit, sealing the nation’s blindness.

  

- **Discourse 2 (10):** Mission to Israel — those who receive the apostles receive Jesus.

- **Development (11–12):** John the Baptist is surpassed by the least in the kingdom; Pharisees resist the Spirit and reveal themselves as Cain’s heirs.

  
  

### III. Rising Action (13–25)

Israel’s rejection shifts Jesus into teaching **parables**, like the greater Isaiah speaking to a hardened people. These parables instruct the disciples (remnant) on the **delay period** before the kingdom’s arrival.

  

**Discourse 3 (13): Parables of the Kingdom**

- **Sower:** The Word/Seed (fulfilled in Jesus) meets different soils; persecution and worldly cares choke many, but good soil bears fruit.

- **Wheat & Tares:** Seeds of the Woman and Serpent grow side by side until judgment.

- **Mustard Seed:** The kingdom during the delay period is not as a cedar tree-reign of the coming Davidic kingdom (Ez. 17) but as a humble mustard tree of faith in Jesus.

- **Leaven:** The kingdom spreads quietly but pervasively through teaching the ancient Word (Ps. 78).
  
- **Wheat and Tares (inclusio):** Jesus returns to the wheat and the tares to bracket the mustard seed and the leaven; these growing entities would grow in the midst of unbelievers (in the very "gates of hell" cf. 16)

- **Treasure & Pearl:** God would sell everything to purchase His treasure, Israel. The pearl is "totally diiferent in its valuation and characteristics."

- **Dragnet:** At the end, all are gathered...no one escapes this kingdom (neither wheat nor tares, whether for salvation or punishment) — righteous separated from unrighteous.

  
  

**Development (14–17):**

- Feeding of 5000/4000 — Jesus sustains the remnant, with enough to feed Gentiles.

- Walking on water — disciples must trust Jesus through the “times of the Gentiles.”

- Peter’s confession — Jesus as cornerstone of the new ecclesia, a mustard tree built in the gates of hell.

- Transfiguration — glimpse of His glory as the true Son of Man and Son of David.

  

**Discourse 4 (18): Ecclesia instructions**

- Childlike faith, forgiveness, and protection from stumbling blocks define the new assembly.

- Forgiveness becomes the core ethic, replacing self-righteous hardness.

  

**Development (19–23):**

- Triumph in Jerusalem — Jesus, as new Temple, cleanses the old temple.

- Parables (Two Sons, Vineyard Tenants, Wedding Feast) expose leaders as Cain-like murderers, rejecting God’s mercy.

- Woes (23) indict them for hypocrisy, blindness, and killing the prophets, aligning them with Abel’s murderers.

  
  

**Discourse 5 (24–25): Olivet Discourse**

- Overview of tribulation: first half (birth pangs), second half (intense trial).

- Delay vs. Tribulation: The parables also instruct the apostles how to shepherd during the **delay period**, not only during future tribulation.

- **Ten Virgins:** Some wait with eternal chesed (goes beyond death, comes from the Word God which does not pass away, Is. 40:8, cf. Matt.24:35), others/Pharisees live for temporal chesed (cf. Is. 5:19, 40:6, comes from natural world).

- **Talents:** The gospel of the kingdom (Word of God) has divine, multiplying power; stewards must invest it.

- **Sheep & Goats:** To receive the apostles is to receive Jesus; true sheep identify with and care for His flock.

  

### IV. Climax (26–28:7)

NOTE: the following well could be the conceputal development of Discourse #5.

Jesus, the greater Moses, enacts a new Exodus. As Passover Lamb and struck Shepherd, He bears Israel’s sins, dies, and rises. Unlike Abel, His blood brings atonement. He alone makes the remnant righteous.

  

### V. Falling Action (28:8–10)

The women announce His resurrection; the remnant is called back to Galilee, where the light first dawned.

  

### VI. Resolution (28:11–17)

The apostles worship in Galilee while Israel conspires with Gentiles to deny the resurrection. The remnant is contrasted with the unbelieving nation.

  

### VII. Denouement (28:18–20)

The risen King sends His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The remnant becomes fruitful Israel, multiplying the righteousness of Jesus among the nations until His return.

## Contribution to the Biblical Narrative

Matthew shows how the promises of the OT converge in the Shepherd-King:

- **Isaiah 9:** A child and king rises in Galilee, launching a remnant from the despised north.

- **Isaiah 6 & 28:** The remnant is refined by the Holy Seed and built on the cornerstone.

- **Isaiah 53 & Zech. 13:** The Shepherd is struck; salvation flows to the remnant.

- **Genesis 12:** Through the Seed of Abraham, fruitfulness extends to all nations.

  

Matthew explains how the Righteous King saves a remnant, builds a mustard-tree ecclesia in the delay, and multiplies His righteousness through them until He returns to reign as the Davidic Cedar Tree (cf. Ez. 17).

Excursus: The Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24–25)

  

The Olivet Discourse stands at the summit of Matthew’s rising action, immediately following the narrative’s emphasis on the delay period (cf. Matt. 22:1–14; 23:29–39). Where the parables had already prepared the disciples for a protracted waiting, Jesus now provides the climactic prophetic framework by which that delay is oriented toward the end.

1. Be Ready in the Delay (24:36–51) — The call to “be ready” functions first for the apostles, who stand as the remnant entrusted with the Word. They are warned that the tribulation could begin at any time, initiated by the "one will be taken [for rescue] and one will be left [for entering the tribulation]." Their own readiness secures the testimony of God’s Word throughout the entire delay period.

2. The Fig Tree and Israel’s Restoration (24:32–36) — The parable of the fig tree ties the end directly to Israel. The budding of the fig tree marks the conclusion of the delay: Israel’s restoration signals that the end is very near. Thus, the delay is not indefinite but oriented toward the covenant people’s renewal. However, what is not "known" by the Son nor anyone else, is the time of the fig tree's budding (the start of the tribulation); thus, in the delay period, the disciples should assume that at any point the tribulation could begin, fronted by the the rescue of believers.

3. Instruction for the Tribulation (24:4–31) — For those who live into the period itself, the discourse provides a clear roadmap. The “abomination of desolation” signals the beginning of the Great Tribulation. Believers must endure, but they are assured that this climactic anguish will be cut short for the elect.

  

Thus, the Olivet Discourse both summarizes and crowns the rising action: the apostles are prepared to wait through the delay, Israel’s restoration provides the marker of transition, and the faithful are assured of the Lord’s coming. The discourse bridges the rejection of Jesus in the present age with the certainty of His glorious return, rooting both discipleship and eschatology in the apostolic witness.

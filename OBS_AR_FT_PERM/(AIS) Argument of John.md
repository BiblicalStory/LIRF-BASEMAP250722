# Argument Summary of John

John presents Jesus as the Word of the Old Testament *made flesh*, resolving the crisis of Genesis 3–4. Israel, functioning as the greater Cain, rejects the greater Abel, yet in so doing fulfills Scripture by offering the efficacious sacrifice that gives life to the world.

---

## Setting (1–4)

The Word becomes flesh as Bridegroom and true Temple, inaugurating purification and new birth. John frames this through overlapping images:  

- **Jacob’s ladder (John 1).** Jesus fulfills Jacob’s dream, with the “Rock” at its base now embodied in Peter’s renaming. The disciples transfer from John the Baptist to Jesus, marking the shift from old covenant to new.  
- **Bride and Temple (John 2–3).** At Cana, water for purification becomes wedding wine, signaling the transformation of OT cleansing into the joy of the eschatological wedding. Nicodemus, the teacher of Israel, cannot grasp the new birth, while the Temple itself is shown to require cleansing and replacement.  
- **Samaritan woman (John 4).** At Jacob’s well, Jesus reveals Himself as Bridegroom and living Temple, offering living water where Israel’s cisterns have run dry. Like Rebekah, she meets the true Seed at the well; like Ephraim in Jeremiah 3, she embodies the divorced north returning more readily than Judah. She becomes the unexpected Bride and first messenger, showing that the Bride will be drawn even from Israel’s fractured and despised past.[^1]  

Together these opening scenes foreshadow the disciples’ mission: messengers who will bear the life of the Word into the world once Jesus departs.

## Conflict (5–11)

Israel rejects the greater Moses and the life the law was meant to bring.  

- **Sabbath healing (John 5).** The lame man represents Israel still helpless in the wilderness. Jesus claims to be the One Moses wrote about, the true Sabbath rest and sanctifier of Israel.  
- **Bread of life (John 6).** As the greater Moses, Jesus provides true manna and reveals Himself as the Passover Lamb. The Jews grumble like their wilderness fathers, but the twelve baskets left over signify the apostles as the remnant provision (showbread) for the coming age.[^2]  
- **Living water (John 7).** Tied to the Feast of Tabernacles and circumcision imagery, Jesus claims to be the fulfillment of Israel’s signs, but they demand more signs and prove blind to the Torah’s intent.  
- **Blindness vs. Light (John 8–10).** Drawing from Isaiah 6–12, the Pharisees are revealed as blind shepherds. By contrast, the healed blind man is a true son of Abraham, recognizing the “Son of Man” and following the Good Shepherd. Jesus lays down His life voluntarily, fulfilling the Father’s command and revealing Himself as the true Shepherd-King.  
- **Resurrection and Life (John 11).** With Lazarus, Jesus demonstrates He is not only a teacher of resurrection but its very embodiment. Israel’s leaders, fearing Rome more than God, resolve to kill Him—climactically rejecting the Light and Life.  

This section frames Israel as the greater Cain, rejecting the greater Abel, fulfilling the prophetic pattern of blindness, grumbling, and failed shepherding.

## Rising Action (12–19:15)

Jesus prepares His disciples to carry His Word in His absence, while He fulfills the Father’s commandment of eternal life through His own obedience.  

- **Fruitful death (John 12).** Like a grain of wheat, Jesus must die to bear fruit for the world. Greeks’ arrival signals the global scope of His mission. His glorification will not come through signs but through death.  
- **Upper Room Discourse (John 13–17).** Jesus, the Servant of Isaiah, washes the disciples’ feet, gives the new commandment to love, and promises the Spirit as His replacement. To “keep [His] commandments” means:  
	  - **Belief** in the Son sent by the Father (6:29; 14:1).  
	  - **Love for one another** as an extension of His love (13:34; 15:12).  
	  In this way, belief and love replace the failed law as the true markers of God’s covenant people. The Spirit will empower them to remember Jesus’ words and to embody them in sacrificial love, sanctifying them in the truth.  
- **Trial (John 18–19:15).** Jesus stands alone as King and true Man. Pilate proclaims, “Behold the Man,” unwittingly naming Him as the New Adam who bears the curse. The Jews’ cry, “We have no king but Caesar,” seals their rejection as greater Cain.  

Here the disciples are prepared, but Jesus must accomplish the Father’s will alone.

---

## Climax (19:16–20:16)

Jesus dies as the Passover Lamb and greater Abel, pierced as Zechariah foresaw. His death is the true Day of Preparation, His blood accomplishing what the law never could. The resurrection proves Him to be not just the giver of life but the Resurrection and the Life Himself, victorious over the Serpent.

---
## Falling Action (20:17–20)

At the tomb, Jesus redirects Mary from touch to mission: “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father… go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” This pivot signals the necessary transition from Jesus’ localized, seen presence to His **Spirit-mediated** presence promised in the Upper Room (John 14–16). The new familial formula—“my Father and your Father”—announces the disciples’ adopted participation in the Son’s relation to the Father, anticipating the sending in 20:21. Mary becomes the first herald to the brethren, modeling that the **next phase is testimony**: life mediated through the **apostolic word** rather than physical sight. The scene also completes John’s Tabernacle arc (“dwelt among us,” 1:14) by preparing for ascension so the Spirit may come, and it quietly evokes **new-creation garden** imagery (the “gardener,” the first day), marking the world’s **re-Genesis** in the risen Christ.[^3]

-------

## Resolution (20:17–29)

Jesus ascends to the Father and breathes the Spirit on His disciples, sending them as He was sent. Their witness now embodies the Word made flesh. Thomas’ confession, “My Lord and my God,” and his validation of Jesus as still being embodied, seals the book’s theological resolution: those who have not seen yet believe are equally blessed, fulfilling the OT’s anticipation of unseen faith.

---

## Denouement (20:30–21:25)

The narrative closes with Peter, the “Rock,” commissioned to feed the sheep even unto death. This fulfills the meaning of Jesus’ “commandments”: belief in Him (the risen Shepherd) and love expressed in feeding His flock. Peter’s sacrificial end becomes the living demonstration that the disciples have kept Jesus’ commandments in the fullest sense.  

Thus the Gospel closes where it began: the Word made flesh forming a remnant through whom God’s life flows, fulfilling both Genesis and the Law as they feed the nations with the words of eternal life.

# Endnotes


[^2]: This student was made aware of the conceptual link to "disciples" in the book of Isaiah by D. Klingler.  
[^3]: The author would like to thank one of his friends for stating this so concisely: "mankind rejected knowledge of God for the knowledge of good and evil."  
[^4]: See David R. Klingler, “Genesis 3:16; 4:1, and 4:7: A Case of Mistaken Identities?” (paper presented at the Evangelical Theological Society Annual Meeting, Denver, CO., November 16th, 2022).

[^5]: The definition of “light” as God’s life: see Charles P. Baylis, “1st John,” BiblicalStory, 2015, BiblicalStory.org.  
[^6]: Building a further conceptual link to the Samaritan Woman is the idea that the Assyrians were the scourge of the northern kingdom, the same geographical area of Galilee, where this incident with Nathaniel took place. Furthermore, the Samaritans were exhibit A of the Assyrian punishment by God’s hand of the northern regions near Samaria in Ephraim, the royal tribe (at least initially, i.e., Jeroboam, cf. Jer. 31:8–9) of the Northern kingdom.

[^10]: In relation to Jesus reciting all of the Samaritan woman's deeds, the implication is that the Word of the OT recited all of Israel’s misdeeds, but at the same time simultaneously cleansed them.  
[^11]: The author appreciates the insight of C. Baylis II in articulating the dynamic of the potential link between the bride-well narratives and John 4.  
[^12]: The twelve baskets left over is the provision that will come from the 12 apostles, who are functioning as the remnant of Israel. The table of showbread (bread of “faces”) in the OT tabernacle contained twelve loaves of bread to represent the 12 tribes of Israel. The location of this bread in the “Holy Place” served as the external witness to that which was behind the veil; this would be the precise function of the apostles, as their Word would be how believers would find life in Jesus’ absence, who functions as the High Priest, according to the upper room discourse found later in this book. See Samuel A. Baylis, “Biblical Theology of Luke–Acts: The ‘Very Present Help’,” Unpublished Paper, 2023, BE8221 Seminar on the Gospels and Acts, Dallas Theological Seminary.  
[^13]: This view was developed by C. Baylis. See Charles P. Baylis, “The Woman Caught in Adultery: A Test of Jesus as the Greater Prophet,” *Bibliotheca Sacra* 146, no. 582 (1989). Since the definition of “malicious witness” is difficult to ascertain based on Deuteronomy 19, see particularly footnotes 33 and 35, relating to the definitions given of a “malicious witness.”  
[^14]: S. Baylis writes regarding the section of Psalms from Psalm 81 to 84: “Psalms 81 through 83 detail God’s discipline upon his nation first (refer back to 73:14), and then to the nations. The phrase of 82:6–7 ‘I said, You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High. Nevertheless, you will die like men and fall like any one of the princes’ indicates that Israel was in the position of representing God to the nations according to God’s voice (cf. 81:11), since they had ‘the Torah’ (the instruction), but like Zedekiah’s sons, they would die cruelly, just like the nations. Psalm 83 then goes to describe the judgment upon the nations, where they become ‘like chaff before the wind,’ which again refers to Psalm 1. Psalm 84 ends with ‘How blessed is the man who trusts in You!’ after describing the joy of the house of the LORD, those who ‘dwell’ there and find their strength in the LORD even in the sojourning. This then contrasts with the wicked who are like chaff. Thus Psalm 81–84 presents the nations, the disobedient Israel, and the remnant of Israel, who truly delights in being near the LORD.” See Samuel A. Baylis, “Argument of the Book of Psalms,” Unpublished Paper, 2022, BE2016A, Dallas Theological Seminary, 26.  
[^15]: That this section (Jn. 11) is the fullness of the conflict was first pointed out to this author by T. Wilson.  
[^16]: In relationship to this concept and the book of 1st John, specifically in 4:17, one may be tempted to think that John is saying there (in 1st John) that just as Jesus “is” in the world, so are the disciples. However, a careful analysis of the pronouns currently is seen by this author with the “He” referring to “God.” Thus, what is being said, is that, just as Jesus was in the world representing the Father, so now are the disciples in the world representing the Father, by carrying the Word. C. Baylis also likely holds this same view.

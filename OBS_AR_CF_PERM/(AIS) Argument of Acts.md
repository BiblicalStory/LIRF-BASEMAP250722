**Message Statement:**  
To Theophilus: In accordance with the OT Scriptures and the “sign of Jonah,” God’s power through the Jewish apostles and believers is using the rejection of the unbelieving Jews to bring a harvest of Gentiles into the new Temple.

## Narrative Framework

- **Setting (1–3):**  
  The risen Jesus promises the Spirit’s power so the apostles can be witnesses. Pentecost fulfills the Feast of Harvest, reversing Babel and birthing the new Temple community. Healing the lame man at the temple gate pictures Israel enabled to “walk” in God’s power.  

- **Conflict (4–13):**  
  The temple leaders and Jews resist this new Temple, becoming jealous as Gentiles are drawn in. Stephen’s speech exposes their idolatry and rejection of the Spirit. Paul’s conversion reveals God’s plan to use him as a chosen instrument for the Gentiles. Jewish blasphemy (13:45) crystallizes the rejection.  

- **Rising Action (14–21):**  
  Paul’s missionary journeys bring Gentiles into the harvest. Signs, council decisions, and teaching establish that salvation is by grace through faith, not law. Paul walks “The Way,” training churches to endure in humility, mercy, and transient hope while Jewish opposition intensifies.  

- **Climax (21:27–23:11):**  
  Paul reports the Gentile harvest in Jerusalem and is dragged out of the temple — just as Stephen was accused before. The temple leaders reject both resurrection and Gentile inclusion, showing themselves worse than Nineveh. God vindicates Paul: “You must witness at Rome also.”  

- **Falling Action (23:12–28:14):**  
  Trials before Roman officials prove Paul innocent. A shipwreck validates him as empowered by the greater Jonah: unlike Jonah, Paul is obedient to bring mercy to Gentiles, preserved, and fruitful on his voyage. The gospel advances unhindered toward Rome.  

- **Resolution (28:15–29):**  
  Paul arrives in Rome, proclaims the hope of Israel (ironically, now parallel to Nineveh), but most Jews reject the message (ironically, unlike Nineveh). Isaiah 6 is fulfilled: Israel is blind and deaf; the salvation of God goes to the Gentiles.  

- **Denouement (28:30–31):**  
  In stark contrast to Jerusalem’s rejection at the old temple, Paul preaches “unhindered” from rented quarters in Rome. The new Temple is now unhindered among the nations, with God’s glory dwelling in human hearts on “The Way.”  



## Endnotes

1. This explanation of the biblical narrative is duplicated from other arguments written by this author.  

2. The concept of “harvest” is implicit in the multiple references to “Pentecost” (Feast of Harvest/Firstfruits, cf. Ex. 23) and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. While often these feasts are thought of in relationship to Passover, it should be noted that even Passover had an agrarian dynamic embedded within it (see Lev. 23:10–11, 15).  

3. The ministry of the apostles is a ministry of grace, like Elisha’s ministry in contrast to that of Elijah (cf. Lk. 9:61). Here, Jesus is the greater Elijah with respect to the disciples, where Jesus’ ministry of judgment was poured upon Himself, and the apostles are ministers of grace. At the same time, Jesus was the greater Elisha with respect to the ministry of John the Baptist. John the Baptist brought the legislation of the Old Covenant, but Jesus brought the grace found in the Old Covenant with respect to His own death as the substitute. See Charles P. Baylis, *The Elijah/Elisha Motif in Luke 7—10 As Related to the Purpose of the Book of Luke* (Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985), BiblicalStory, http://thebiblicalstory.org/baylis/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Elijah_Elisha_Luke_Thesis_Baylis_1985.pdf.  

   Paul’s identity as being from Tarsus is ironic, given that this was potentially the place to which Jonah fled to escape God’s call to the Gentiles. However, the identity of Tarsus as Tarshish is disputed, but was nonetheless supported by Josephus. See Lowell K. Handy, “Tarshish,” in *The Lexham Bible Dictionary*, ed. David Bomar et al. (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016).  

4. The author would like to thank his colleague J. Coke for pointing out the importance of including Theophilus into the message statement of the book.  

5. This concept of the “sign of Jonah” was pointed out to this author by C. Baylis. See Charles P. Baylis, “The Book of Acts,” *BiblicalStory*, 2015, http://thebiblicalstory.org/baylis/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actslec081315Web.pdf.  

6. In accordance with the argument of the gospel of Luke, the mission will not merely be carried out by the apostles only, but also others because it is to be a “humble flock” not built upon human identity, but upon the working of God’s power (Luke 9:48–50).

7. Note that both the Passover and the festival of the harvest (Pentecost) were to be celebrated “…in the place which the LORD chooses…” See also Samuel A.

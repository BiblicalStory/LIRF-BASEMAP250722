**Message Statement:**  
To Theophilus: In accordance with the OT Scriptures and the “sign of Jonah,” God’s power through the Jewish apostles and believers is using the rejection of the unbelieving Jews to bring a harvest of Gentiles into the new Temple.

## Narrative Framework

- **Setting (1–3):**  
  The risen Jesus promises the Spirit’s power so the apostles can be witnesses. Pentecost fulfills the Feast of Harvest, reversing Babel and birthing the new Temple community. Healing the lame man at the temple gate pictures Israel enabled to “walk” in God’s power.  

- **Conflict (4–13):**  
  The temple leaders and Jews resist this new Temple, becoming jealous as Gentiles are drawn in. Stephen’s speech exposes their idolatry and rejection of the Spirit. Paul’s conversion reveals God’s plan to use him as a chosen instrument for the Gentiles. Jewish blasphemy (13:45) crystallizes the rejection.  

- **Rising Action (14–21):**  
  Paul’s missionary journeys bring Gentiles into the harvest. Signs, council decisions, and teaching establish that salvation is by grace through faith, not law. Paul walks “The Way,” training churches to endure in humility, mercy, and transient hope while Jewish opposition intensifies.  

- **Climax (21:27–23:11):**  
  Paul reports the Gentile harvest in Jerusalem and is dragged out of the temple — just as Stephen was accused before. The temple leaders reject both resurrection and Gentile inclusion, showing themselves worse than Nineveh. God vindicates Paul: “You must witness at Rome also.”  

- **Falling Action (23:12–28:14):**  
  Trials before Roman officials prove Paul innocent. A shipwreck validates him as empowered by the greater Jonah: unlike Jonah, Paul is obedient to bring mercy to Gentiles, preserved, and fruitful on his voyage. The gospel advances unhindered toward Rome.  

- **Resolution (28:15–29):**  
  Paul arrives in Rome, proclaims the hope of Israel (ironically, now parallel to Nineveh), but most Jews reject the message (ironically, unlike Nineveh). Isaiah 6 is fulfilled: Israel is blind and deaf; the salvation of God goes to the Gentiles.  

- **Denouement (28:30–31):**  
  In stark contrast to Jerusalem’s rejection at the old temple, Paul preaches “unhindered” from rented quarters in Rome. The new Temple is now unhindered among the nations, with God’s glory dwelling in human hearts on “The Way.”
